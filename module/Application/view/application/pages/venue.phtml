        The SunshinePHP Developer Conference venue will be Embassy Suites Miami International.  The hotel will be a wonderful setting for the event with a beautiful tropical themed atrium, newly renovated restaurant, Starbucks coffee station, great patio with a pool (shown below), and session rooms close by one another with sponsor tables nestled in the middle.

        If you have not registered for this PHP conference yet, now is the time register and take advantage of the special rate.  Register early to take advantage of the special hotel room rate for all attendees the event. (<strong>Full "made to order" breakfast is included.</strong>) The conference will have events planned for the nights of February 6th and 7th, so we recommend that you stay for 4 nights (or 3 nights if you are not attending the tutorial day), arriving on Wednesday, February 5th, and leaving on Sunday, the 9th.  This will ensure you arrive the day before the conference tutorial day to be well rested for a day crammed with great talks.  Then leave the day after, so you can take advantage of the evening events on the last day.
